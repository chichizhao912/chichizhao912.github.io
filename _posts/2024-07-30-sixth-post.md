### Day 6 #100DaysOfCode

Today I decided to start off with something different! I wanted to learn first about SQL and databases a bit more, so I started the course on The Odin Project.

## Databases Course
**Progress: 33%**
I first learnt about databases and relational databases. I then learnt the basics of SQL and how to write queries. It was a lot simpler than I had imagined haha.
