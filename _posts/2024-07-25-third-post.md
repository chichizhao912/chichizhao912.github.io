### Day 3 #100DaysOfCode

Hi guys! Today I will be moving onto learning about HTML, CSS, and how to use these languages - very exciting haha. 

## Foundations Course
First, I learned the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - and also their different purposes. 

**HTML**
Next I moved onto HTML. A good analogy for elements/tags is the wrapping paper analogy. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQuIIv2RVA.
Elements are the different structures, tags are to indicate the beginning and end.

HTML Structure = Boilplate (interesting name)

Add <!DOCTYPE html> to the start of the page as a doctype declaration. 
Then add:
- Head
- Meta
- Title
- Body

Remember to use the ! short-cut on VSC!
