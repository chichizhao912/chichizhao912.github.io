### Day 3 #100DaysOfCode

Hi guys! Today I will be moving onto learning about HTML, CSS, and how to use these languages - very exciting haha. 

## Foundations Course
First, I learned the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - and also their different purposes. 

**HTML Basics**
Next I moved onto HTML. A good analogy for elements/tags is the wrapping paper analogy. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGQuIIv2RVA.
Elements are the different structures, tags are to indicate the beginning and end.

**Learning**
HTML Structure = Boilplate (interesting name)

Add <!DOCTYPE html> to the start of the page as a doctype declaration. 
Then add:
- Head
- Meta
- Title
- Body

Remember to use the ! short-cut on VSC!

Great page for info about links/images: https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/links-and-images/#image-formats
- Has info on 4 types of images
- Which best to use
- How to resize, etc.

**Practice**
I then did lots of practice and built my first web-page! I included:
- Lists
- Links - to both external and my own pages
- Different text styles (bold and italics)
- Different headers
- Images

I also went online and learnt how to use JS to make a password page, so that I could make the website include a password to unlock feature.
