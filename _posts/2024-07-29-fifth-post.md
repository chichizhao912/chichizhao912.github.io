### Day 5 #100DaysOfCode

## Foundations Course
**Progress: 54%**

Today, I spent most of my time on practice. I completed several CSS practices, and built a Red Panda website for practice, using some CSS. 

I also did some reading on Block and Inline elements.

For the time being, I decided to skip some of the formatting course elements as I want to be able to dive into databases/functionality first, as that is what my goal is to do first. I do aim to come back to front-end develop more.
