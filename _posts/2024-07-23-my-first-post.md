### Day 1 #100DaysOfCode

Hi guys!

Today I started of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. I'm super excited to dive straight into learning. How I plan on doing this challenge is a bit different, as I would like to learn both software developing skills, and also improve my ML skills (e.g. with applications in mech-interp). So, I've put my progress separately below. 

To learn software developing, I am currently taking the Odin Project's Foundations Course. 

## Foundations Course
**Progress Today: 25% Completed**

Firstly, I learnt the basics of computers and the internet/web, using the resources of 
This was a good way to learn about servers, IP addresses, and DNS.

**VSCode:**

I watched this tutorial on VSCode and it had lots of useful tips and tricks:

**Setting Up Git:**

I successfully followed the Odin Project's instructions to set up Git on my laptop. I also created my first SSH key! It went more smoothly than I thought haha.
