### Day 1 #100DaysOfCode

Hi guys!

Today I started of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. I'm super excited to dive straight into learning. How I plan on doing this challenge is a bit different, as I would like to learn both software developing skills, and also improve my ML skills (e.g. with applications in mech-interp). So, I've put my progress separately below. 

To learn software developing, I am currently taking the Odin Project's Foundations Course. 

## Foundations Course
**Progress Today: 25% Completed**

Firstly, I learnt the basics of computers and the internet/web, using the resources of 
This was a good way to learn about servers, IP addresses, and DNS.

**VSCode:**

Since I've mostly coded in Spyder before, I learnt how to use VSCode as a new code editor. 

I watched this tutorial on VSCode and it had lots of useful tips and tricks:

This was a useful tutorial I watched on how to view code output as you code:

**Using Shell:**

- Learnt using bash
- https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir.html
- https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create.html
- Learnt the different commands for shell (ls, cd, pwd, etc.)

_Note to self: Use these websites as reference for future_

**Setting Up Git:**

I successfully followed the Odin Project's instructions to set up Git on my laptop. I also created my first SSH key! It went more smoothly than I thought haha. 

## AI/ML Study
**Neel Nanda - What is a transformer?**
I didn't have too much time today, so a quick intrp, I watched Neel Nanda's "What is a transformer video".

Take-aways:
- Intro to logits, tokens, vectors (conversions) - with probability distribution
- Each token prediction uses all the tokens behind it - auto-regressive!

**Plans**
To get started in mech-interp research, I will go through the steps outlined here: https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/prereqs

Now, that's it for today! See you tomorrow ;)
