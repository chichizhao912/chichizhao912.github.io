### Day 2 #100DaysOfCode

Hi guys! Welcome to Day 2 of my coding challenge.

## Foundations Course
**Progress: 27%**

**Git**
First, I'm learning about Git and how to use it!
Notes:
- Version control system
- Git is a distributed VCS
- Good initial explanation to watch first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM
- Centralised VCS can be dangerous - easily to lose if central repository goes down
