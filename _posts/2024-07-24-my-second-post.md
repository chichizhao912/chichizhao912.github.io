### Day 2 #100DaysOfCode

Hi guys! Welcome to Day 2 of my coding challenge.

## Foundations Course
**Progress: 29%**

**Git Basics**
First, I'm learning about Git and how to use it!
Notes:
- Version control system
- Git is a distributed VCS
- Good initial explanation to watch first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM
- Centralised VCS can be dangerous - easily to lose if central repository goes down

**Practice!**
I then went through the Odin Course homework task to do some practice. I was able to successfully use Git commands to clone my repository on Github, use the Git workflow, modify a file, and push my work to GitHub. After thinking everything through and practicing a bit, this process was much easier than I first imagined!
