##Foundations Course
**Progress: 52%**
Today I will be continuing my "journey of learning" by focusing on CSS. 

I am currently completing the CSS Foundations part of the course. 

Summary of what I've learnt in CSS!

**CSS Intro**
- Syntax of CSS: Selector, Property, Value
- Different types of selectors
- Class: Add a . in front
- ID: Add a #
- Group: Add a , between
- Chaining selectors - use without separation
- Descendant combinator: add a space in between, put ancestor first

- Properties: colour, font, align, height/width of image

**Add CSS to HTML**
- Use external CSS
- Internal is other option
- Inline - only for very unique/specific

**The Cascade**
The order of CSS depends on many things - this is the nuanced way of determining what
 layout an element will actually have. 

Order of Preference:
- ID
- Class
- Type selectors
- Universal

Inheritence exists, however direct CSS that targets an element beats inheritence

Rule Order

**Inspect!**
I then learned about how to use Chrome Dev Tools! I loved this part of the course - it's super useful.
