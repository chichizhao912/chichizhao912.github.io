Hi guys!

My name is Chi Chi and I'm a current pre-med student in Australia. This is just a simple blog to document my progress in different areas of my interest. My current goals are to learn both skills for software engineering and ML/mech-interp. I plan on doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I learn/code for at least 1 hour each day.
